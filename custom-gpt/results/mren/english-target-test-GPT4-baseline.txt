COVID-19 is a disease that can affect your lungs and airways and sometimes other parts of your body too.
It is caused by the coronavirus.
COVID-19 is highly infectious.
It spreads through droplets produced when people cough or sneeze, or when they touch surfaces where these droplets have landed and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
COVID-19 can be a serious disease, leading to hospitalization and even death.
Primary symptoms of COVID-19:
Fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher)
Cough (this can be any type of cough, not just dry)
Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Loss or change in sense of smell or taste - meaning you notice you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to you.
It's not necessary to have all these symptoms; you might just feel worse than on a normal day.
Symptoms can take up to 14 days to appear.
They can be similar to those of a cold or flu.
If you have any common symptoms of COVID-19, isolate yourself from others (stay in your room) and call your doctor (GP).
They can arrange for you to be tested for COVID-19.
Who is at higher risk from COVID-19?
People aged 65 or older and those with special health conditions are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill if they get COVID-19.
What is the COVID-19 vaccine?
The vaccine is a substance that can improve immunity to certain diseases.
The COVID-19 vaccine will protect you from infection by COVID-19.
If people are vaccinated, the number of people who become seriously ill or die from COVID-19 in that community can decrease.
The COVID-19 vaccine will protect you from COVID-19 infection.
Vaccination is safer for your immune system in the context of COVID-19 infection.
Who will get the vaccine?
The list of priority groups can be seen on this website: www.gov.ie/covid19vaccine
But whether to get vaccinated or not is up to you, HSE, the World Health Organization, and the Health Department recommend that you should get vaccinated as soon as you have the opportunity.
The vaccine will be administered as soon as it is available in Ireland.
When it's your turn to get the COVID-19 vaccine, we will invite you directly through advertising.
But it is important not to contact the HSE for vaccination beforehand.
Before getting vaccinated, read this 'leaflet' and the 'Manufacturer's Patient Information Leaflet'.
You can view the 'Manufacturer's Patient Information Leaflet' at www.hse.ie/covid19vaccinePIL
You can first speak to any healthcare worker.
If you decide to get vaccinated, you will need to give your consent, which will be recorded.
HSE is providing the vaccine for free.
Why is it so important to get the COVID-19 vaccine?
The COVID-19 vaccine will reduce your risk from COVID-19 and protect you from the serious complications of the disease.
Our aim in vaccinating people is to protect them and reduce the number of deaths caused by this virus.
Do I need to get vaccinated if I have already been infected with COVID-19?
Yes.
Even if you have been infected with COVID-19 before, you can get infected again.
Vaccination will reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 again.
Even if you get COVID-19 again, the vaccine will reduce the severity of your symptoms.
Should I get the vaccine now if I currently have COVID-19?
No, you should not get the vaccine until you have recovered from COVID-19.
Do this:
Wait at least four weeks after the symptoms appear or four weeks after testing positive for COVID-19.
About getting the vaccine
Who is my vaccinator?
They are trained by HSE to administer the COVID-19 vaccine.
Can getting the COVID-19 vaccine cause you to get COVID-19?
No, the COVID-19 vaccine cannot cause you to get infected with COVID-19.
It is possible that you were infected with COVID-19 before getting the vaccine and only became aware of the symptoms after being vaccinated.
If you have any common symptoms of COVID-19, you must isolate yourself from others (stay in your room) and arrange for a free test to check for COVID-19.
If you develop a fever more than two days after getting vaccinated or if the fever lasts for more than two days, you should isolate yourself from others and get tested for COVID-19 by a doctor (GP).
Even if you show symptoms of COVID-19 after the first dose, you still need to take the second dose.
While the first dose can provide some protection, the second dose will give you better protection against the virus.
Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I have a high temperature?
No.
If you have a fever (38 degrees Celsius or higher), you should wait until you feel better before getting vaccinated.
Is it safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women to get the vaccine?
There is no evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe if you are pregnant.
Vaccines have not been widely tested on pregnant women, so there is limited evidence available at this time. 
If you are a healthcare worker or belong to a high-risk group and are pregnant, you should discuss getting the COVID-19 vaccine with your obstetrician or doctor (GP). 
If you are breastfeeding, you can get the COVID-19 vaccine. 
Which vaccine am I being given? 
The vaccine we are administering is called Comirnaty, which is produced by Pfizer/BioNTech. 
This mRNA vaccine teaches your body to produce a type of protein that can trigger an immune response without using the COVID-19 virus. 
Then your body produces an antibody that will help fight the infection if the COVID-19 virus enters your body in the future. 
Is the vaccine safe? 
The HSE only uses vaccines when they meet the necessary safety and efficacy standards. 
The development of the COVID-19 vaccine is happening more quickly than usual. 
The vaccine we are giving you has gone through all the necessary steps to ensure it is safe and effective for development and approval. 
To obtain approval for the use of the COVID-19 vaccine, it adheres to international safety standards and has undergone all the clinical trials and safety screenings through which all other licensed medicines go. 
The vaccine we are administering is called Comirnaty, produced by Pfizer/BioNTech. 
It has been tested on thousands of people during clinical trials. 
It meets strict standards for safety, quality, and effectiveness and has been approved by regulators and licensed.
For Ireland, the regulatory body is the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - for more information, visit www.ema.europa.eu. 
How is the COVID-19 vaccine administered? 
The COVID-19 vaccine is given as an injection in the upper arm. 
It takes a few minutes. 
How many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine do I need? 
For optimal protection, you will need two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. 
You will need to get the second dose 28 days (four weeks) after receiving the first dose. 
What are the side effects of the vaccine? 
Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects. 
Most of these are mild and short-term, and not everyone gets them. 
More than 1 in 10 people may experience the following symptoms: 
Feeling tired 
Tenderness or swelling at the injection site on the arm 
Headache 
Muscle pain
Joint pain 
Feeling jittery 
Fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher) 
After vaccination, more than 1 in 1,000 people may experience itching at the injection site, swelling in the lymph nodes, or trouble sleeping. 
Bell's palsy is a rare side effect seen in more than 1 in 10,000 people. 
Severe side effects, such as allergic reactions, are extremely rare, occurring in nearly one in a million people for all vaccines. 
Your vaccinator is trained to treat rare severe allergic reactions. 
People who have had facial fillers may sometimes experience swelling on their face. 
This is found in more than 1 in 10,000 people. 
The COVID-19 vaccine has gone through the same clinical trials and safety screenings as all other licensed vaccines.
But this vaccine is new and information on long-term side effects is limited. 
As more and more people in Ireland and around the world are vaccinated, more information on side effects will become available. 
HSE will regularly update this information on our website and, if necessary, will update the information leaflet given to people about the first or second dose of the vaccine. 
Fever after vaccination
Fever after vaccination is a very common symptom. 
Usually, it occurs within two days (48 hours) of receiving the vaccine and goes away within the next two days. 
You are more likely to get a fever after the second dose of the vaccine. 
If you feel unwell, take paracetamol or ibuprofen as directed in the box or leaflet. 
If you are concerned, seek medical advice. 
Are there any people who should not take the COVID-19 vaccine?
You should not get the COVID-19 vaccine if:
You have had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine (including polyethylene glycol).
See the ‘Manufacturers Patient Information Leaflet’ for a list of ingredients.
You have had a severe allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine.
If you have had a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine, injection, or polysorbate 80, talk to a doctor before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
Most people can safely receive the vaccine.
The person administering the vaccine will be ready to answer your questions at the time of your appointment.
After-care advice related to vaccination will be provided on the back of the leaflet.
On the day of vaccination, you will also receive a vaccine record card that includes the name and batch number of the vaccine administered.
How long does it take for the vaccine to work?
Most people will have immunity (protection) after receiving two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
This means they will be protected from COVID-19.
It takes 7 days after getting the second dose for it to work.
The likelihood of getting infected with COVID-19 after vaccination is very low.
Does the vaccine work in everyone?
Every year, vaccines save the lives of at least 2 to 3 million people worldwide and protect many from lifelong diseases.
Millions of people worldwide have already received the COVID-19 vaccine.
There is solid evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces your risk of getting COVID-19.
The vaccine is highly effective at preventing death and serious illness caused by COVID-19.
If your immune system is weak, there is no extra risk in getting the vaccine, but it may not be as beneficial for you.
If I am vaccinated, it means I will not spread COVID-19 to others.
We do not yet know if getting vaccinated stops you from spreading the COVID-19 virus to others.
It is important to continue following public health advice to stop the spread of the virus.
In special circumstances, you still need to:
Follow social distancing guidelines (keep a distance of two meters from others where possible).
Cover your face.
Wash your hands regularly.
Thank you for keeping yourself and others safe.

HPRA cannot provide medical advice on individual cases.
It is essential for people to seek treatment-related advice from their healthcare professional (your doctor or pharmacist).
After your Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccination,
Thank you for keeping yourself and others safe until vaccination.
After your vaccination, we want you to carefully read this document as it will help you understand what effects you may feel in the coming days and where to find more information.
You should read the information given to you today.
We are also giving you a record of today's vaccination.
Please keep the record card safe.
What could happen in the next few days?
Some people who get the vaccine may experience the following symptoms:
Tenderness or swelling at the injection site on the arm.
Muscle pain
Diarrhea
Fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher)
As with any vaccination, you can report side effects to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).
Please report any side effects experienced from the COVID-19 vaccination on the website www.hpra.ie/report.  
What if I start to feel feverish or unwell?
If this happens, you can take paracetamol or ibuprofen.
If you have a fever for more than 48 hours, you can contact a doctor.
If you are pregnant, you should not take ibuprofen.
Do I need to do anything before getting the second dose of the vaccine?
If you are getting the second or final dose of the vaccine, inform the vaccination team about any changes in your health since the first dose.
Keep the report card with you when you go to get the second dose.
This will happen in the next 28 days (4 weeks).
Good news
The COVID-19 vaccine will protect you from serious consequences of COVID-19.
The vaccine will stimulate your immune system to protect against the disease.
Vaccination is safer for your immune system than getting COVID-19 itself.
We are still learning.
The effect takes place 7 days after receiving the second dose.
Even after getting vaccinated, there is a small chance that you could become infected with COVID-19.
We still do not know if being vaccinated prevents you from spreading the virus to others, therefore, you should follow public health advice.
Follow the guidelines for maintaining social distance (keep a distance of 2 meters from others).
Wear masks.
Wash your hands regularly.
Do you have any questions?
If you are uncertain about something or have any questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, please ask us or

Attention should also be given to ILI and SARI by the health system and fever clinics.
This includes contacts within the family, local community, workplace, and others.
The rate of positive cases found should be less than 5 percent of all tests.
Efforts should be made to create containment zones based on patient numbers, their contact tracing, digital mapping.
Attention should be given to whether home isolation is being conducted in accordance with central guidelines.
A thorough investigation should be conducted, along with complete genome sequencing.
Steps should be taken regarding this.
Therefore, the district administration should focus on implementing strict and effective measures according to the guidelines of the Central Health Department.
They keep an ear to the ground to avoid being caught off guard.
Such a question arises.
If we look at the history of infectious diseases, often in the second wave, the speed of the spread of the disease and the rate of people falling ill is higher.
Let's learn through some graphics.
Then, the number of patients gradually decreased.
It shows how the daily number of patients increased over three months.
This is the highest single-day increase in Maharashtra so far.
Now, with the second wave, the number of patients is again rising in urban areas like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur.
On February 25, the number reached 6,740.
Many people went to their villages for voting, and the frequency of travel also increased.
Experts say that after the first wave of COVID subsided, people became lax in taking precautions, which is why the numbers are rising again.
But currently, 60 percent of COVID patients are in Maharashtra.
Of those, 166,353 patients are in Maharashtra alone.
Out of those, 23,29,464, which is nearly 20 percent of patients, are in Maharashtra.
Kerala is in the ninth position in this list. (Data as of March 19)
On December 24, 2020, the state conducted 1,28,820 tests.
Experts speaking to the BBC have expressed concern over this issue.
This means that even though the number of patients is increasing, the death rate has significantly decreased compared to the first wave.
In September, the death toll had gone beyond four hundred on some days.
Until March 18, 3,804,142 people in Maharashtra had been given the vaccine dose.
Experts say that research is necessary to determine whether mutations in the virus are responsible or not.
But what changes are happening can be understood from the cell's genome.
In January, a group of genomic scientists stated that "even with 14 million cases in India, only 6,400 genomes had been sequenced."
They also mentioned that actions had been taken against 2 million people in Mumbai for not wearing masks.
Students of 10th and 12th grades have been exempted from this.
Shopping malls will only be open until 10 PM.
A maximum of 5 people will be allowed for daily religious, worship, and cleaning activities at religious places.
This lockdown will be in place until midnight on March 31.
But during this time, medical services, offices of the media, milk selling, vegetable, and fruit selling will continue.  
Classes for 10th and 12th grades have been closed.  
A domestic wedding ceremony can be attended by 50 people.  
However, some strict restrictions have been imposed in the district to break the chain of coronavirus infection.  
The decision has been made that the "No Mask, No Entry" policy must be enforced.  
Customers must be provided with sealed meals in their rooms.  
There is a night curfew from 11 PM to 5 AM.  
But the limits for wedding ceremonies and funerals apply there as well.  
In this, identification cards have been issued by the commission.  
Therefore, the guidelines for taking exams have also changed.
If you have your own vehicle, it's best.  
While going to the center, avoid outside food and drinks as much as possible.  
Avoid going in groups, obviously.  
Follow social distancing meticulously.  
Then sit down.  
The commission has made wearing gloves mandatory.  
Because everyone has the same concern as you.  
During that period, avoid sharing food and water from each other's boxes strictly.  
Create a sort of bio bubble around yourself.  
Then it can be done continuously on the phone.
But after the exam is over, head straight home.  
After such a big exam, the mind guarantees a release.  
Currently, the number of patients in Maharashtra is increasing rapidly.  
But if students cooperate, it won't put pressure on the administrative system.  
Therefore, supervisors and representatives of the administration should cooperate from time to time.  
They provided this information through Twitter.  
Everyone who has come into contact with me should take care and get tested.  
They have called for adherence to rules against the backdrop of COVID-19.  
Then, due to COVID-19, 70 deaths have been recorded.  
Vegetable, fruit, and grocery stores will now remain open until 4 PM.
I have come to attend the meeting organized by the district administration to discuss this situation.  
On March 18, 2021, the city recorded 2,913 patients, meaning those infected with coronavirus.  
The death of 14 people in a single day due to coronavirus has also been recorded.  
This results in immense loss for the poor.  
Due to an increase in people's immunity against coronavirus, the death rate has decreased.  
Even though the number of coronavirus patients is increasing, a large number of patients are undergoing home isolation treatment due to the increased immunity among citizens.  
According to the district administration, 15,000 citizens were tested for coronavirus in the last 24 hours.  
The city's epidemic search teams from the Municipal Corporation are collecting fines from citizens who violate the rules.  
Vaccination against coronavirus is underway at government medical colleges - hospitals, such as Mayo, AIIMS, and in the Municipal Corporation's hospitals as well as private hospitals.  
The situation is serious, and the Chief Minister said that health facilities will be insufficient in 15-20 days.
I will be speaking with experts in the next 2 days.  
Today we might reach or exceed the figure of 45,000 patients.  
The situation in France is critical.  
First and foremost, it is important to save the lives of the people.  
Even after receiving both doses of the vaccine, some people have been infected.  
Therefore, I need your cooperation too.  
Students protested in Mumbai today against this decision of the government.  
Currently, the number of COVID-19 cases in the state is increasing at a record rate.  
Students took to the streets in Pune and Nashik in the last few days for this demand.  
After that, the police arrived at the scene and detained 15 to 20 students.
Additionally, many students in remote and rural areas are facing difficulties with online education, leading to a lack of study progress, according to these children.  
I have explained to them.  
You will have to take the exams.  
Then, the practical exams for the 12th grade will be conducted between May 22 and June 10.  
Varsha Gaikwad has announced that after the results of these two exams, a third supplementary exam will also be conducted.  
Subsequently, the regulations for these restrictions were also published.  
Relief has been provided in these rules for the exams of 10th and 12th grades.  
This year, students will be given more time to write their papers.  
Therefore, we are trying to conduct the exams in the most tension-free environment possible.  
Varsha Gaikwad said, "The number of students taking the board exams is more than 30 lakhs."
If there is a shortage of classrooms in that school, nearby schools will also be used as centers.  
Taking this into account, Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad has announced an increase in the time allocated for writing papers.  
Also, Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik has announced that there will be a strict lockdown from Friday night at 8 PM to Monday morning at 7 AM.  
Medicines will not be given to those who do not need them.  
If strict measures are not implemented soon, there could be a shortage of hospital beds.  
Last time, the Prime Minister suddenly imposed a lockdown, and workers were stranded.  
Against this backdrop, the administration has decided to make the restrictions even stricter.  
They also spoke with many leaders.  
This recklessness can be dangerous for oneself as well as others.  
A similar type of mini lockdown has been imposed in other places as well.
If citizens do not voluntarily follow the rules for COVID-19, Chief Minister Thackeray had said that a decision would be taken about it in two days.  
If anyone in our family or I contract COVID-19, will the government take responsibility?  
Then, why didn't the Education Department consider this exceptional situation?  
Then, why should only we risk our lives?  
These questions were raised by students taking the exam while speaking with BBC Marathi.  
Only the exams of the board, that is, 10th and 12th, were mentioned as exceptions in this context.  
The exams are scheduled to take place in April and May, with another opportunity to take the exams in June under certain conditions for the students.  
There is a curfew in the state, with a complete lockdown on Saturdays and Sundays.  
Thus, it appears that the Uddhav Thackeray government is firm about conducting the board exams.  
There is no clarity in the new regulations issued by the government.
Do we have to wear hand gloves?  
The exam center will be the school or junior college where they are studying.  
Because if exams are not conducted in April-May, the evaluation of answer sheets for millions of students will be delayed.  
For this demand, students also protested with placards and slogans.  
Hence, there are questions and confusion in the minds of students.  
We also met with the School Education Minister, Varsha Gaikwad.  
Seeing the increasing cases of COVID-19 in the state, we were expecting that the government would change the decision regarding exams, she says.  
The facility of beds is falling short.  
Will this not affect our results and future admissions?  
Young people are now also getting infected with COVID-19.
Why hasn't the Education Department provided various options?  
We need to have 55% for admission to medical colleges.  
Because their future higher education paths depend on the basis of this exam.  
Experts say that conducting exams successfully for millions of students in such exceptional circumstances will be a big challenge.  
There is a rush to conduct the written exams for 10th and 12th grades.  
The situation of online education in rural areas is extremely dire.  
The subject has not been taught/understood, and yet there is an exam to be written.  
But in such exceptional circumstances, it is also appealed not to insist on conducting exams.  
Insisting on exams according to a predetermined plan and timetable will not be useful.  
Can other alternatives to exams be considered?
But quality is also important for us.  
But we cannot guarantee that students will follow all the rules carefully and cautiously.  
BBC Marathi took an interview with the School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad on 31 March 2021, just a few days ago.  
Or if a lockdown is announced in the future, students can take exams in June.  
Therefore, she also said that it is necessary to conduct exams.  
When asked, Varsha Gaikwad said, "I cannot answer this.  
What will students from villages do if their internet connection is lost during an exam?  
Many students' lunchboxes are not ready by 6 PM.  
Some students are demanding that the exam be postponed, while others insist that it should be conducted as per the schedule.  
Some students in Pune preparing for competitive exams have also been infected with COVID-19.
Because if the report comes back positive, you cannot appear for the exam.  
This fear also exists in the minds of the students.  
If these students go to the exam, the infection will spread.  
She says that due to restrictions, if lunchboxes are not received on time, getting parcels from hotels is not affordable.  
Many students have no other option, so they stay in Pune out of necessity.  
To be able to appear for the exam, some students are taking medicines without testing for symptoms they are experiencing and continue to study.  
The situation with meals in Pune has become difficult.  
Many students are showing symptoms of COVID-19.  
Students are not getting tested because if the test is positive, they will have to quarantine.  
We also participated in the protests, but the situation was different then.
So, if exams are conducted, students will go back to their homes, and the spread of infection will reduce, they also say.  
They have published a letter regarding this.  
They are getting through the day with painkiller pills from their doctor friends.  
So, the cases must have actually increased.  
One infected student can spread the infection to many.  
But the main difference between the first and second wave of COVID-19 is the 'vaccine'.  
Therefore, there is a demand that everyone over the age of 25 in Maharashtra, which accounts for 60% of the active cases in the country, should be vaccinated.  
The demand to remove the age restriction for vaccination and to vaccinate everyone over 25 years of age has been made by Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  
The largest organization of doctors in the country, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), has written to the Prime Minister to bring the age limit for vaccination down to 18 years.  
Therefore, all individuals over the age of 25 should be given the COVID-19 preventive vaccine.
For this, they have requested 1.5 crore additional vaccines from the central government.  
Soon after, the central government announced that vaccination for this age group would start from 1 April.  
IMA has written a letter to the Prime Minister demanding that everyone over the age of 18 be vaccinated.  
This increases an individual's immunity, creates the possibility of herd immunity in society, and reduces the severity of the disease, so IMA has also suggested setting up 'walk-in' vaccination centers everywhere.  
Citing vaccination campaigns in other advanced countries around the world, the central government says that the current strategy of vaccinating certain groups in a certain way is appropriate.  
Vaccines should be given to those age groups that are at higher risk.  
If you look at countries like Britain, America, France, Sweden, and others around the world, they have not vaccinated everyone indiscriminately.  
Their criteria for vaccination are even stricter than ours.  
There has been rapid research on vaccines worldwide.  
That is why vaccines are being given first to those who are at risk and have diseases.
When the issue of age limit comes up for discussion, and such demands are made, all eyes will be on the stance Prime Minister takes.  
We are observing that patients in the age group of 22 to 45 are the most numerous.  
Therefore, there is also a need to act quickly.  
But have we completed the task by vaccinating everyone over 45 years?  
If it's said to immediately vaccinate everyone above 25 years, it will incur additional costs.  
But this question has become not just political but also a matter of extreme financial concern.  
They have asked for a deadline of two days to make an appropriate decision.  
But there are protests by the business community in many cities within the state.  
Traders in Pune have staged demonstrations on the famous Laxmi Road by forming chains and displaying banners.  
In that, we have decided to protest.
An announcement was made in the evening and it changed at night.  
Today, there was a protest in the second capital, Nagpur as well.  
They have now demanded that the government allow all shops to open for five days a week.  
All of us traders assure that we will take the necessary safety precautions, as stated in this letter.  
This will also control the crowd even if it gets too large.  
Accordingly, the government's stance is expected to be clear by Friday.  
The Chief Minister has said that the demands of the business community will be considered seriously, but how to find a way out is not yet clear.  
We have to move forward by taking everyone into confidence.  
In their Facebook Live, they also advised patience.  
Afterwards, these parties had shown support for whatever steps the government would take.
Raj Thackeray has also held a press conference demanding that instead of keeping shops closed every day, permission should be given to open them for a few days a week.  
Yashomati Thakur has written a letter to the Chief Minister requesting to relax the restrictions specifically for Amravati district.  
Such actions cannot ignore local opposition.  
Nagpur's Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar reported the death of three men and one woman patient.  
This hospital was designated as a private mini COVID hospital.  
'Other coronavirus-infected patients from Well Treat Hospital have been shifted to other COVID hospitals in the city,' informed Nitin Raut, the Guardian Minister of Nagpur.  
At that time, 5 patients were being treated in the ICU.  
During this time, local social worker Suraj Wankhede was present in the hospital.  
Three critical patients were evacuated due to smoke filling up the entire ICU.  
Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis has instructed the District Magistrate to provide all possible help to the patients and the injured.
My condolences are with the relatives of the deceased.  
On Friday (9 April 2021), 58,000 new COVID-19 cases were found in the state.  
During this period, only essential services will continue.  
To clear the doubts of the citizens, the state's Disaster Management Department has issued a list of frequently asked questions and their answers.  
If the rules are not being followed, the local administration can make decisions with the permission of the state government.  
Or you can order home delivery according to the rules.  
But, you cannot dine in.  
But, dining in at hotels is not allowed.  
In Amaravati city, there was sparse crowding at major squares like Rajkamal Chowk, Irwin Chowk, Panchvati, Jaystambh, etc.  
Except for essential services, all shops in the city are closed.
The streets in areas like Dasara Chowk, Kawala Naka, Mirajkar Tikti, and the bus station vicinity are deserted.  
But the decision to postpone it was taken in a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.  
The empathy alive in you today has been seen once again in Maharashtra.  
It was nearly half-past ten at night.  
Essential services have been exempted from this.  
Many states in the country have done the same.  
All these states are taking such decisions looking at each other, and none of the state governments have declared that this decision was taken as per the central government's instructions.  
The Maharashtra government is trying to stop such people by implementing a night curfew.  
BBC asked the Delhi government for a comment on this, but no official response has been received.  
The responses from all three are different.
The government is concerned about this issue and is taking some measures, as evident from this.  
The transmission of coronavirus occurs mostly through droplets.  
These droplets settle on surfaces.  
Some extremely fine droplets can remain suspended in the air for some time.  
Where there is moving air, the likelihood of coronavirus spreading is less, and in closed spaces like restaurants, bars, gyms, there is a higher probability of the virus spreading.  
If people voluntarily reduce visiting such places, the government will not need to enforce restrictions.  
Another point is that people go out less for work at night and mostly for leisure.  
But this causes economic damage.  
Preventing people from moving from one place to another without a solid reason could be a broad policy.  
Creating containment zones to restrict people's movement could be another approach.
This is not a very effective way to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but the issue is becoming serious, and if people do not take it to heart now, the situation could worsen, surely this message goes out to the people.  
Research in science has proven that reducing people's movement can control the spread of the coronavirus.  
The letter's final part clearly states that weekend lockdowns and night curfews have very little effect in stopping the spread of the coronavirus.  
He was admitted to the hospital for treatment a few days ago.  
He has written that he will need to stay in isolation for the next few days.  
Sachin tweeted, "Thank you for your wishes and prayers.  
Wishing all Indians and my teammates on the tenth anniversary of our World Cup victory," Sachin had said in a tweet.  
After contracting the coronavirus, Sachin is quarantined at home, where his treatment continues, he has informed.  
Meanwhile, my coronavirus test has come back positive today.  
I am undergoing all treatments as per doctors' advice.
Before this, Environment Minister Aditya Thackeray and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray's wife Rashmi Thackeray were also infected by coronavirus.  
What did Rajesh Tope say after the task force meeting?  
The meeting discussed the coronavirus situation in the state.  
The task force expressed that the excessive and irrational use of Remdesivir also needs to be stopped.  
The meeting between Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the COVID Task Force Committee took place, and a final decision regarding the lockdown is likely to be made after the discussion.  
The number of tests conducted in the last 3 days has exceeded 2 lakh.  
On April 7th, 235,749 tests were conducted in the state, including 133,344 RT-PCR and 102,405 antigen tests.  
60% of the patients are in home isolation, while 40% are in institutional isolation.  
This will be discussed in the meeting.  
"We need a policy regarding our employees' salaries and tax concessions."
Accordingly, it is necessary for laborers and workers at construction sites to stay at the site. Only transportation of materials will be allowed.  
So, while implementing a complete lockdown again, the government will also have to consider the salaried class.  
There has been no discussion about any changes in this regard yet."  
Also, to ensure that passengers traveling out of town are not affected, some long-distance trains will not be immediately stopped.  
The number has now decreased to 15-16 lakhs.  
A complete lockdown has been implemented on Saturdays and Sundays.  
But if the dining area is part of a hotel, it can remain open for guests staying there, with no entry for outsiders.  
The industrial and production sectors will continue to operate, but health regulations at these places must be followed.  
"If Maharashtra does not receive additional vaccine supply within eight days, we will not allow a single vehicle from Serum Institute of Pune to move out of Maharashtra."  
The politicization of vaccines in the case of Maharashtra is deplorable, as mentioned in the editorial of Saamana.
The Chief Minister has called for a task force meeting tomorrow (April 11) to make a decision regarding the lockdown after the meeting.  
Sources present at the meeting informed BBC Marathi that there is consideration for imposing a strict lockdown again in the state.  
Is there adequate preparation if a lockdown is imposed in the state?  
The state government faces a significant challenge in stopping the spread of coronavirus.  
However, they could not attend the meeting due to having undergone surgery on their hand.  
Priority must be given to saving lives first.  
But the rapidly increasing infection and patient numbers must be curbed at all costs.  
If we are to win this battle under such circumstances, some tough decisions will have to be made.  
Because they are now exhausted by the constant economic crisis.  
Priority consideration should be given to what help can be provided to those who must be closed down.
