COVID-19 is a disease that can affect your lungs and airways and sometimes other parts of your body.  
It is caused by a virus known as coronavirus.  
COVID-19 is highly contagious.  
It spreads through droplets produced when people cough or sneeze, or when they touch surfaces where these droplets have landed and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.  
COVID-19 can be a serious disease, leading to hospitalization and even death.  
Primary symptoms of COVID-19:  
Fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher)  
Cough (this can be any type of cough, not just dry)  
Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath  
Loss of smell or taste or changes in these senses - meaning you may notice you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different than usual.  
Not everyone will have all these symptoms. It's possible that you just feel unwell compared to a normal day.  
It can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear.  
These symptoms can be similar to those of a cold or flu.  
If you have any common symptoms of COVID-19, you should isolate yourself from others (stay in your room) and call your doctor (GP).  
They can arrange for you to be tested for COVID-19.  
Who is at higher risk from COVID-19?
People over the age of 65 and those with certain health conditions are at greater risk of serious illness if they contract COVID-19.  
What is the COVID-19 vaccine?  
A vaccine is a substance that can improve immunity against specific diseases.  
The COVID-19 vaccine will protect you from infection by COVID-19.  
If people are vaccinated, the number of individuals getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 in the community could decrease.  
The COVID-19 vaccine will protect you from the infection.  
In the context of a COVID-19 infection, vaccination is safer for your immune system.  
Who will get the vaccine?  
A list of priority groups is available on this website: www.gov.ie/covid19vaccine  
But whether to get vaccinated or not is up to you, HSE, the World Health Organization, and the Department of Health recommend that you get vaccinated as soon as the opportunity is available.  
The vaccine will be administered in Ireland as soon as it is available.  
When it is your turn to get the COVID-19 vaccine, we will directly invite you through advertisements.  
But it is important not to contact the HSE for vaccination before then.  
Read this 'leaflet' and the ‘Manufacturer's Patient Information Leaflet’ before getting vaccinated.  
You can view the ‘Manufacturer's Patient Information Leaflet’ at www.hse.ie/covid19vaccinePIL.  
You should first speak to a healthcare provider.  
If you decide to get vaccinated, you will need to give your consent, which will be recorded.  
HSE is offering the vaccine for free.  
Why is getting the COVID-19 vaccine so important?  
The COVID-19 vaccine will reduce your risk of contracting COVID-19 and protect you from the serious complications of the disease.  
Our goal in vaccinating people is to protect them and reduce the number of deaths caused by this virus.  
Do I need to get vaccinated if I have already been infected with COVID-19?  
Yes.  
Even if you have been previously infected with COVID-19, you can still get infected again.  
The vaccine will reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 again.  
Even if you contract COVID-19 again, the vaccine will reduce the severity of your symptoms.  
Should I get vaccinated now if I currently have COVID-19?  
No, you should not get vaccinated until you have recovered from COVID-19.  
Do this:  
Wait at least four weeks after your symptoms appear or four weeks after testing positive for COVID-19.
Regarding getting the vaccine  
Who is my vaccinator?  
They are trained by HSE to administer the COVID-19 vaccine.  
Can the COVID-19 vaccine cause COVID-19?  
No, the COVID-19 vaccine cannot cause a COVID-19 infection.  
It is possible that you were infected with COVID-19 before receiving the vaccine and became aware of the symptoms after vaccination.  
If you have any common symptoms of COVID-19, it's necessary to isolate yourself from others (stay in your room) and arrange for a free COVID-19 test.  
If you have a fever after two days of getting vaccinated or if the fever lasts for more than two days, you should isolate yourself from others and get tested for COVID-19 by a doctor (GP).  
Even if you have symptoms of COVID-19 after the first dose, it is necessary to take the second dose.  
While the first dose can provide some protection, taking the second dose will offer better protection from the virus.  
Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I have a high temperature?  
No.  
If you have a fever (38 degrees Celsius or higher), you should wait until you feel better before getting vaccinated.  
Is it safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women to get the vaccine?  
There is no evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe if you are pregnant.  
Extensive testing of the vaccine on pregnant women has not been done, so there is limited evidence available at this time.  
If you are a healthcare worker or belong to a high-risk group and are pregnant, you should discuss getting the COVID-19 vaccine with your obstetrician or doctor (GP).  
If you are breastfeeding, you can get the COVID-19 vaccine.  
Which vaccine am I receiving?  
The vaccine we are administering is called Comirnaty, produced by Pfizer/BioNTech.  
This mRNA vaccine teaches your body to produce a type of protein that can trigger an immune response without using the COVID-19 virus.  
Your body then makes antibodies that will help fight the infection if the COVID-19 virus enters your body in the future.  
Is the vaccine safe?  
HSE only uses vaccines when they meet the required standards for safety and effectiveness.  
The development of the COVID-19 vaccine is proceeding at an unprecedented pace.  
The vaccine we are providing you has gone through all the necessary stages for safe and effective development and approval.  
The COVID-19 vaccine has gone through all the clinical trials and safety checks that all other licensed medicines go through, following international standards for safety to obtain approval for use.  
The vaccine we are administering is called Comirnaty, produced by Pfizer/BioNTech.  
It has been tested on thousands of people during clinical trials.  
It meets the strict standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness and has been approved by regulators and licensed.
For Ireland, the regulatory body is the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - for more information, visit www.ema.europa.eu.  
How is the COVID-19 vaccine given?  
The COVID-19 vaccine is administered as an injection in the upper arm.  
It only takes a few minutes.  
How many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine do I need?  
For optimal protection, you will need two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.  
You will need to get the second dose 28 days (four weeks) after the first dose.  
What are the possible side effects?  
Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects.  
Most are mild, short-lived, and not everyone gets them.  
More than 1 in 10 people may experience the following symptoms:  
Feeling tired  
Tenderness or swelling at the injection site on the arm  
Headache  
Muscle pain
Joint pain  
Feeling chills  
Fever (38 degrees Celsius or higher)  
After vaccination, more than 1 in 1,000 people may experience itching at the injection site, swelling in lymph nodes, or insomnia.  
Bell's palsy is a rare side effect seen in more than 1 in 10,000 people.  
Serious side effects like allergic reactions are extremely rare, nearly one in a million for all vaccines.  
Your vaccinator is trained to treat severe allergic reactions.  
People who have had facial fillers may occasionally experience swelling on their face.  
This is seen in more than 1 in 10,000 people.  
The COVID-19 vaccine has gone through the same clinical trials and safety checks that all other licensed vaccines go through.  
But the vaccine is new, and information on long-term side effects is limited.  
As more people worldwide are vaccinated, more information on side effects will become available.  
HSE will regularly update this information on our website and update the information leaflet given to people about the first or second dose if necessary.  
Fever after vaccination  
It's very common to develop a fever after vaccination.
Typically, fever occurs within two days (48 hours) after getting the vaccine and goes away within the next two days.  
There is a higher likelihood of fever after the second dose of the vaccine.  
If you feel unwell, take paracetamol or ibuprofen as instructed in the box or leaflet.  
If you are concerned, seek medical advice.  
Are there any people who should not take the COVID-19 vaccine?  
You should not take the COVID-19 vaccine if:  
You have had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine (including polyethylene glycol).  
For a list of ingredients, see the ‘manufacturer's patient information leaflet’.  
You have had a severe allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine.  
If you have had a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine, injection, or polysorbate 80, discuss with your doctor before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.  
Most people can safely receive the vaccine.  
The person administering your vaccine will be ready to answer your questions at your appointment.  
After-care advice related to the vaccination will be provided on the back of the leaflet.  
On the day of vaccination, you will also be given a vaccine record card, which will list the name and batch number of the vaccine given.  
How long does it take for the vaccine to work?  
Most people will have immunity after receiving two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.  
This means they will be protected from COVID-19.  
It takes 7 days after getting the second dose for it to work.  
The chance of becoming infected with COVID-19 after vaccination is significantly reduced.  
Does the vaccine work in everyone?
Vaccines save at least 2 to 3 million lives each year worldwide, and most people remain protected from diseases for life.  
Millions of people around the world have received the COVID-19 vaccine to date.  
There is solid evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.  
The vaccine is very effective at preventing death and serious illness caused by COVID-19.  
If your immune system is weak, there is no additional risk in getting the vaccine, but it may be that the vaccine may not be as beneficial for you.
If I get vaccinated, it means I will not spread COVID-19 to others.
We do not yet know if getting vaccinated stops you from spreading the COVID-19 virus to others.
That's why it's important to continue following public health advice to stop the spread of the virus.
In particular situations, you still need to:
Follow the guidelines for social distancing (keep a distance of two meters from others where possible).
Wear a face covering.
Wash your hands regularly.
Thank you for keeping yourself and others safe.
How long does immunity last after vaccination?
We do not yet know how long immunity lasts after vaccination.
Clinical trials are underway to gather more information.

Where to file a complaint about side effects? 
As with any vaccination, you can file a complaint about side effects with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). 
HPRA is the regulatory authority for medicines, medical devices, and other health products in the Republic of Ireland. 
HPRA operates a system for the surveillance of medicine safety, where healthcare workers or members of the public can report any suspected adverse reactions to medicines and vaccines that have occurred in Ireland. 
HPRA encourages the reporting of suspected adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines to ensure ongoing safety and effectiveness monitoring.
It operates a system through which healthcare workers or members of the public can report any suspicious side effects of medicines and vaccines that have occurred in Ireland.  
The HPRA strongly encourages reporting of any suspected adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines to ensure ongoing monitoring of their safe and effective use.  
To report a suspected adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine, please visit www.hpra.ie/report.  
You can also ask your doctor or any family member to report on your behalf.  
As much information as possible should be collected, and where possible, mention the batch number of the vaccine.
HPRA cannot provide medical advice in individual cases.  
It is essential for people to contact their healthcare professional (your doctor or pharmacist) for treatment-related advice.  
After your Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccination  
Thank you for keeping yourself and others safe until vaccination.  
After your vaccination, we would like you to carefully read this document as it will help you understand what effects you may experience over the next few days and where to find more information.
You should read the information given to you today.  
We are also giving you a record of today's vaccination.  
Please keep the record card safe.  
What can happen in the next few days?  
Some people who get the vaccine might experience the following symptoms:  
Soreness or swelling at the injection site on the arm.  
Muscle pain  
Diarrhea  
Fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher)  
As with any vaccination, you can report side effects to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).  
Please report any side effects experienced due to the COVID-19 vaccination at www.hpra.ie/report.  
What if I develop fever or pain?  
If you experience these, you can take paracetamol or ibuprofen.  
If you have a fever for more than 48 hours, you should contact a doctor.  
If you are pregnant, you should not take ibuprofen.
Is there anything I need to do before getting the second dose of the vaccine?  
If you are taking the second or final dose of the vaccine, inform the vaccination team about any changes in your health since your last dose.  
Keep your report card with you when you go to get your second dose.  
This will happen within the next 28 days (4 weeks).  
Good news  
The COVID-19 vaccine will protect you from the severe effects of COVID-19.  
The vaccine will stimulate your immune system to protect you from the disease.  
Compared to the transmission of COVID-19, vaccination is safer for your immune system.  
We are still learning.  
The effect of the vaccine occurs 7 days after taking the second dose.  
Even after being vaccinated, there is still a small chance that you can get infected with COVID-19.  
We do not yet know if getting vaccinated stops you from spreading the virus to others, so you should follow public health advice.  
Follow the guidelines for maintaining social distance (keep a 2-meter distance from others)  
Wear masks  
Regularly wash your hands

Objection to the processing of your personal data.
Additionally, health systems and fever clinics should also monitor ILI and SARI.
This should include family, local community members, workplaces, and others who have been in contact.
The positivity rate of found cases should be less than 5% of the total tests conducted.
Efforts should be made to prepare containment zones based on the number of patients, their contact tracing, and digital mapping.
Attention should be given to whether home isolation complies with the central guidelines.
A thorough investigation should be conducted, and complete genome sequencing should also be performed.
Steps should be taken regarding this.
Therefore, the district administration should focus on implementing strict and effective measures in accordance with the guidelines of the central health department.
Then they keep their ears open to avoid being caught by the hidden ones.
Such a question should arise.
Looking at the history of infectious diseases, often in this second wave, the speed of disease spread and the rate of people getting sick is higher.
Let's understand this through some graphics.
Subsequently, the number of patients gradually decreased.
It shows how the daily number of patients increased over three months.
This is the highest one-day increase in Maharashtra so far.
Now, with the second wave coming, the number of patients is again increasing in urban areas like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur.
On February 25, this number reached 6,740.
Many went to their villages for voting, and the number of travelers also increased.
Experts say that after the first wave of COVID subsided, people became complacent in taking precautions, which also led to an increase in numbers again.
But currently, 60% of COVID patients are in Maharashtra.
Of these, 166,353 patients are in Maharashtra alone.
Out of these, 23,29,464, which is almost 20% of the patients, are in Maharashtra.
Kerala is in the ninth position in this list. (Data as of March 19)
On December 24, 2020, there were 128,820 tests conducted in the state.
Experts expressed concern about this issue while speaking with the BBC.
This means that even though the number of patients is increasing, the death rate is much lower compared to the first wave.
In September, for a few days, the death toll had crossed four hundred.
By 18th March, 3,804,142 individuals in Maharashtra had been given the vaccine dose.
Experts say it is necessary to research whether the mutation in the virus is not responsible for this.
But what exact changes are occurring can be understood from the genome of the cell.
In January, a group of genomic scientists stated that "even with 14 million cases in India, only 6400 genomes were sequenced."
They also mentioned that actions were taken against 2 million people in Mumbai for not wearing masks.
Students of 10th and 12th grades have been excluded from this.
Shopping malls will also be open until 10 pm.
The daily rituals, worship/cleaning of the premises should be carried out in the presence of no more than 5 individuals.
This lockdown will be in place until midnight of 31st March.
But during this period, medical services, media offices, milk sales, vegetable and fruit sales will continue.
Classes for 10th and 12th grades have been suspended.
A domestic wedding ceremony can be attended by up to 50 people.
However, some strict restrictions have been imposed in the district to put a break on the spread of coronavirus.
A decision has been made that the "No Mask, No Entry" policy must be enforced.
Customers must be provided with sealed meal services in their rooms.
This night curfew is from 11 PM to 5 AM.
But the limitations for wedding ceremonies and funerals will also apply there.
Identification cards have been issued by the commission.
Therefore, the guidelines for taking exams have also changed.
It's best if you have your own vehicle.
Avoid eating and drinking outside when going to the center as much as possible.
Avoid going in groups, of course.
Strictly follow social distancing.
Then sit down.
The commission has made wearing gloves mandatory.
Because everyone, like you, is concerned.
During that period, strictly avoid sharing food and water from each other's containers.
Create a sort of bio-bubble around yourself.
Then it can be done continuously on the phone.
However, after the exam is over, head straight home.
After such a big exam, it feels like a release.
Currently, the number of patients in Maharashtra is increasing rapidly.
But if students cooperate, it will not put additional pressure on the administration system.
Therefore, supervisors and representatives of the administration should be cooperated with from time to time.
They provided this information through Twitter.
Everyone who has been in contact with me should take care and get tested.
They have appealed for adherence to the rules in the context of Corona.
Then, 70 deaths were recorded due to Corona.
Vegetables, fruits, and grocery stores will now remain open until 4 pm.
I have come to attend a meeting organized by the district administration to discuss this situation.
On 18 March 2021, the city recorded 2,913 patients, meaning cases of COVID-19 were noted.
On the same day, 14 deaths were also recorded due to Corona.
This causes immense harm to the poor.
Due to increased immunity against Corona among people, the death rate has decreased.
"Even though the number of Corona patients is increasing, a large number of patients are undergoing home isolation treatment due to the increased immunity among citizens."
According to the district administration, 15,000 citizens were tested for Corona in the last 24 hours.
Fines are being collected by the municipal corporation's epidemic investigation teams from citizens who violate the rules.
Vaccination against Corona is underway at government medical colleges - hospitals, Mayo, AIIMS, and municipal as well as private hospitals in the city.
The situation is serious, and the Chief Minister has said that health facilities will become inadequate in 15-20 days.
I will be talking to experts in the next 2 days.
Today, we might reach or cross the figure of 45,000 patients.
The situation in France is critical.
Our top priority is to save the lives of the people.
Even after receiving both doses of the vaccine, some people have been infected.
Therefore, I need your cooperation too.
Students in Mumbai protested today against the government's decision.
Currently, the number of COVID-19 patients in the state is increasing rapidly.
In the last few days, students in Pune and Nashik have taken to the streets for this demand.
Subsequently, the police arrived at the scene and detained 15 to 20 students.
Many students from remote and rural areas are also saying they have faced difficulties in online education, affecting their studies.
I have explained to them.
You will have to take the exams.
Then, the practical exams for the 12th grade will be held between May 22 and June 10.
After the results of these two exams, a third supplementary exam will also be conducted, as informed by Varsha Gaikwad.
Subsequently, the guidelines for these restrictions were also published.
Relief has been provided in these rules for the 10th and 12th-grade exams.
This year, students will be given more time to write their papers.
"Our effort is to conduct the exams in the most tension-free environment possible," said Varsha Gaikwad.
Varsha Gaikwad stated, "The number of students appearing for the board exams is more than 30 lakhs."
If the classes in that school fall short, nearby schools will be used as centers.
Taking this into account, Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad has announced that the time for writing the paper has been increased.
Also, Minority Minister Nawab Malik has announced that a strict lockdown will be in place from Friday night 8 PM to Monday morning 7 AM.
Medication will not be given to those who do not need it.
If strict measures are not taken soon, the number of hospital beds might fall short.
Last time, the Prime Minister suddenly imposed a lockdown, and laborers were stuck.
In that background, the administration has decided to make the restrictions stricter.
They also spoke with many leaders.
This recklessness can be dangerous for oneself and others.
A similar kind of mini lockdown has been imposed in other places as well.
If citizens do not voluntarily follow the Corona rules, a decision will be taken about it in two days, as Chief Minister Thackeray had said.
Is the government going to take responsibility if anyone in our family or I contract Corona?
Then why didn't the education department consider this exceptional situation?
Why should only we risk our lives?
Students appearing for the exams raised all these questions while speaking with BBC Marathi.
Only exams for the 10th and 12th boards are mentioned as exceptions.
Exams are scheduled for April and May, with an opportunity to retake the exams in June under certain conditions.
A curfew is in place in the state, with complete lockdowns on Saturdays and Sundays.
Thus, the Uddhav Thackeray government seems determined to conduct the board exams.
There is no clarity in the government's new guidelines.
Are you supposed to wear hand gloves?
The examination center will be the school or junior college where they are studying.
If exams are not conducted in April-May, checking millions of students' answer sheets will be delayed.
Students also protested with placards and slogans for this demand.
Therefore, students are confused and have questions.
We also met with the Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad.
She said that we were hoping the government would change its decision on exams seeing the rising COVID cases in the state.
Facilities for beds are falling short.
Will this not affect our results and further admissions?
Young people are now getting infected with Corona too.
Why hasn't the Education Department provided various alternatives?
We are required to have 55% for admission to medical colleges.
Because their higher education paths depend on these exams.
Experts say conducting exams for millions of students in such exceptional circumstances will be a big challenge.
Now, the attempt is being made to conduct written exams for 10th and 12th grades.
The situation for online education in rural areas is extremely dire.
The subject is not taught/understood, and yet the exam has to be written.
But in such exceptional circumstances, it is also appealed not to insist on conducting exams.
Insisting on exams as per the planned schedule and timetable will not be beneficial.
Can other alternatives for exams be considered?
But quality is also important for us.
But we cannot guarantee that students will follow all the rules carefully and cautiously.
BBC Marathi took an interview with the School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad just a few days before, on 31 March 2021.
"Or if a lockdown is announced in the future, students can take the exams in June," she mentioned.
Therefore, she also said that conducting exams is necessary.
Asked about this, Varsha Gaikwad said, "I cannot answer this.
What will the children in the village do if the internet connection is lost during the exam?
Many messes do not prepare the lunchbox by 6 o'clock.
Some students are demanding to postpone the exam, while others insist on conducting the exam as per the schedule.
Some students in Pune preparing for competitive exams have also contracted Corona.
Because if the report comes positive, they won't be able to take the exam.
This fear is also in the minds of the children.
If these students go for the exams, the infection will spread.
She says that if tiffins are not delivered on time due to restrictions, and it's not affordable to get parcels from hotels.
Many students have no other option, so they stay in Pune out of necessity.
Students are taking some medicines without testing, even when showing symptoms, just to be able to take the exam.
The situation of meals in Pune has become difficult.
Many children are showing symptoms of Corona.
They are not getting tested fearing if tested positive, they will have to quarantine.
"We also participated in the protests, but the situation was different then."
Therefore, if exams are conducted, students will go back to their homes, and the spread will decrease, they say.
They published a letter regarding this.
They are spending their days taking painkiller pills from their doctor friends.
Therefore, the cases must have increased.
One infected student can spread the infection to many.
But the main difference between the first and second wave of Corona is 'vaccine'.
Hence, there is a demand to vaccinate everyone above 25 years in Maharashtra, which accounts for 60% of the active cases in the country.
The age restriction on vaccination should be removed, and everyone above 25 should be vaccinated, as demanded by Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The largest doctors' association in the country, 'Indian Medical Association' (IMA), has written to the Prime Minister to bring the age limit down to 18 years.
Therefore, "COVID preventive vaccination should be given to everyone above 25."
For this, they have requested 1.5 crore additional vaccines from the center.
Soon after, the central government announced vaccination for this age group starting from 1st April.
IMA has written to the Prime Minister demanding vaccination for everyone above 18 years.
This increases an individual's immunity, creates a possibility of herd immunity in society, and reduces the severity of the disease, as mentioned in their letter, IMA has suggested setting up 'walk-in' vaccination centers everywhere.
Citing vaccination underway in other advanced countries worldwide, the central government says that the current strategy of vaccinating certain groups in certain ways is appropriate.
Only those who are at higher risk should be vaccinated.
If you look at Britain, America, France, Sweden, and other countries worldwide, they have not vaccinated everyone indiscriminately.
Their criteria for vaccination are even stricter than ours.
Research on vaccines has progressed rapidly worldwide.
That's why vaccines are being given first to those who are at risk and have diseases.
When the issue of age limit comes up for discussion, and such a demand is made, what stance the Prime Minister takes will be watched.
In that, we see that patients between the ages of 22 to 45 are the most.
Therefore, there is also a need to work quickly.
But have we completed the task by vaccinating everyone above 45?
If it's said to immediately vaccinate everyone above 25, it will incur additional costs.
But this question has become not just political but also a significant financial one.
They asked for two days to make the appropriate decision for that.
But in many cities across the states, there are protests by the business community.
In Pune, traders on the famous Laxmi Road formed a chain and demonstrated with placards.
That's when we decided to protest.
A different announcement was made in the evening, and it was changed at night.
Today, there was also a protest in Nagpur, the second capital.
They have now demanded the government allow all shops to open five days a week.
All of us traders assure that we will take all necessary precautions for safety, as stated in this letter.
This will also control the crowd even if it gets very crowded.
Accordingly, the government's stance is expected to be clear by Friday.
The Chief Minister has said that the demands of the business community will be seriously considered, but it is not yet clear how this will be resolved.
We need to move forward taking everyone into confidence.
In their Facebook live, they also advised patience."
Afterward, these parties had shown support for whatever steps the government would take.
Raj Thackeray has also demanded in a press conference that instead of keeping shops closed every day, some days in the week should be allowed to open.
Yashomati Thakur has written to the Chief Minister requesting to relax the restrictions for Amravati district.
When taken up, local opposition cannot be ignored.
Nagpur's Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar reported the death of three men and one woman patient.
This hospital was given the status of a private mini COVID hospital.
"Other COVID-19 patients at Well Treat Hospital have been shifted to other COVID hospitals in the city," informed Nitin Raut, the guardian minister of Nagpur.

In Amravati city, usual bustling places like Rajkamal Square, Irvin Square, Panchavati, Jaystambh, saw sparse crowds.
Except for essential services, all shops in the city are closed.

The sensitivity you show today once again makes Maharashtra proud.
It was almost half-past ten at night.
Essential services have been exempted.
Many states in the country have done the same.
All these states are taking such decisions by observing each other, but no state government has officially announced that this decision was taken following the central government's instructions.
Maharashtra government is trying to stop such people by imposing a night curfew.
BBC asked the Delhi government for a comment on this but hasn't received an official response yet.
Their answers are different.
It shows that the government is concerned and is implementing some measures.
The spread of Corona is most due to droplets.
These droplets settle on a surface.
Some extremely fine droplets can stay suspended in the air for some time.
Where the air circulates, there's less chance of spreading Corona, and in closed spaces like restaurants, bars, gyms, there's a higher chance of spreading.
If people voluntarily reduce going to such places, the government won't need to enforce it.
Another thing is that at night, people go out less for work and more for leisure.
But this causes economic damage.
Preventing people from moving from one place to another without a solid reason could be a broader policy.
Creating containment zones to restrict people's movement could be another approach.
This is not a very effective way to stop the spread of the Coronavirus, but this problem is now taking a serious form and if people do not take it seriously now, the situation could worsen, is the message definitely reaching the people.
But reducing public movement and controlling the spread of Corona has been proven by scientific research.

This number has exceeded 2 lakh tests in the last 3 days.
On 7th April, the state conducted 235,749 tests, including 133,344 RT-PCR and 102,405 antigen tests.
60% of patients are in home isolation, while 40% are in institutional isolation.
This will be discussed in the meeting.
"We need a policy regarding our employees' salaries and tax relief."
Accordingly, it is necessary for workers and laborers to stay at the construction sites. Only the transportation of materials will be permitted.
Thus, now when imposing a full lockdown again, the government has to consider the working class too.
"No discussion has been held yet regarding making changes to this."
Also, to prevent passengers traveling to other towns from being affected, some long-distance trains will not be immediately canceled.

Sources present in the meeting informed BBC Marathi that there is consideration of imposing a strict lockdown in the state again.

Facing a significant challenge to stop Corona is in front of the state government.
However, they did not attend the meeting because they had undergone surgery.
We must prioritize saving lives first.
But the rapidly increasing infection and patient count must be stopped by any means necessary.
To win this battle in such a situation, some sacrifices must be made.
Because, already exhausted by the constant financial crisis.
Those who have to close, priority should be given to what assistance can be provided to them.
