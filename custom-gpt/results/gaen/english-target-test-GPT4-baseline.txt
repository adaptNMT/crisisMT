About this information leaflet
In this leaflet, you are provided with information about the COVID-19 (coronavirus) vaccine.
It tells you:
what COVID-19 is
what the COVID-19 vaccine is
who should get the vaccine
why it is important to get the vaccine
who should not get it and who should delay vaccination
vaccine safety and side effects
where to find more information
Please read this information leaflet carefully.
You can also talk to a healthcare professional about the vaccine – your General Practitioner or your Pharmacist, for instance.
What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is an illness that can affect your lungs and airways, as well as other parts of your body in some cases.
It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.
COVID-19 is highly contagious.
It spreads through the air by droplets that are emitted when people cough or sneeze, or when someone touches surfaces that these droplets are on and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
COVID-19 can cause severe illness, lead to hospitalization, or even cause death.
Among the common symptoms of COVID-19 are:
a new cough – any type of cough, not necessarily dry
shortness of breath or breathing difficulties
loss of smell or taste – this means you have noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to you
You may not have all these symptoms, or you may just feel worse than usual.
Sometimes it can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear.
They can be similar to symptoms of a cold or flu.
If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, self-isolate (stay in your room) and call your General Practitioner.
He or she will be able to arrange a COVID-19 test for you.
Who is most at risk from COVID-19?
Older people and people with certain pre-existing health conditions are the most at risk of severe illness if they contract COVID-19.
What is the COVID-19 vaccine?
A vaccine is a substance that aims to improve immunity (protection) against a certain disease.
The COVID-19 vaccine will protect you from COVID-19.
If people are vaccinated, it should reduce the number of people in our community who become seriously ill or even die from COVID-19.
Vaccines teach your immune system how to protect against disease.
It is much safer for your immune system to learn this through vaccination than by contracting COVID-19.
Who should get the vaccine?
You can find a list of the groups to be vaccinated on this website: www.gov.ie/covid19vaccine
While it is up to you to decide whether to get the vaccine or not, the HSE, World Health Organization, and the Department of Health strongly recommend that you get it as soon as it is offered to you.
Vaccines will be given to people as supplies arrive in Ireland.
When the time comes, we will let you know how to get the vaccine through advertising or by inviting you directly.
It is important that you do not contact the HSE about vaccination beforehand.
You will need to read this leaflet and the Manufacturer's Patient Information Leaflet before you get the vaccine.
You can find the Manufacturer's Patient Information Leaflet at: www.hse.ie/covid19vaccinePIL
You can also talk to a healthcare professional beforehand.
If you decide to get the vaccine, you will need to give your consent, and this consent will be recorded.
The vaccine is being provided by the HSE for free.
Why is it important to get the vaccine?
The vaccine should reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 and protect you against the serious complications associated with it.
By offering the vaccine to the public, our aim is to protect people and reduce the illness and deaths caused by the virus.
I have already had COVID-19, do I need to get the vaccine?
Yes.
Even if you have already had COVID-19, you could contract it again.
The vaccine will reduce the risk of you contracting COVID-19 again.
Even if you contract COVID-19 again, the symptoms are expected not to be as severe as a result of the vaccine.
I currently have COVID-19, should I get the vaccine?
You should not.
You should delay getting vaccinated until you have recovered from COVID-19.
Wait:
at least four weeks after you first noticed symptoms or
four weeks after you received a positive test result for COVID-19
Getting the vaccine
Who is my vaccinator?
The vaccinator is the person who will give you the vaccine.
The HSE trains him or her to administer COVID-19 vaccines.
Can the COVID-19 vaccine give you COVID-19?
The COVID-19 vaccine cannot give you COVID-19.
You may have contracted COVID-19 before receiving the vaccine and not noticed the symptoms until after your vaccination appointment.
If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, it is very important to self-isolate (stay in your room) and arrange to get a free test to find out if you have COVID-19.
If you develop a fever more than two days after receiving the vaccine, or it lasts for more than two days, you should self-isolate and ask your General Practitioner to arrange a COVID-19 test for you.
If you develop COVID-19 symptoms after the first dose, you still need to get the second dose.
While you may receive some protection from the first dose, it is the second dose that will provide you with the best protection against the virus.
Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I have a high temperature?
You should postpone vaccination if you have a fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher) until you feel better.
Should I get the vaccine if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?
If you have received the first dose of the vaccine and you are breastfeeding, you should get your second dose.
If you have received the first dose of the vaccine and you are pregnant, you should get your second dose by the 36th week of pregnancy if at all possible.
There is a higher risk of severe illness if you do not receive the second dose.
More information is available at www.hse.ie/covidvacpreg
Which vaccine is being offered to me?
The vaccine we are offering you is called Vaxzevria.
It is manufactured by AstraZeneca.
It is a viral vector vaccine, containing a harmless version of another virus (the vector).
This will teach your body how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response.
Then your body will start producing antibodies, which will play their part in fighting the infection if COVID-19 enters your body in the future.
Is the vaccine safe?
The HSE only uses vaccines that meet the required standards of safety and efficacy.
Although the COVID-19 vaccines were developed much faster than usual, the vaccine we are offering you went through all the normal stages necessary to prove it is both safe and effective.
To authorize the use of the COVID-19 vaccine, it passed all the clinical trials and safety checks that all other licensed medicines must satisfy, and did so according to international safety standards.
The vaccine we are offering you is called Vaxzevria and it is manufactured by AstraZeneca.
About the vaccine:
It has been tested on thousands of people as part of clinical trials
It met strict safety, quality, and efficacy standards, and is approved and licensed by regulators.
In the case of Ireland, the regulator is the European Medicines Agency – visit www.ema.europa.eu for more information.
How is the COVID-19 vaccine given?
The vaccine is given as an injection into the upper arm muscle.
It will only take a few minutes.
The second dose must be received between 8 weeks and 12 weeks after the first dose.
How many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine will I need?
You will need two doses of the vaccine to get long-lasting protection.
You will receive the second dose between 8 weeks and 12 weeks after the first dose.
What are the side effects associated with the vaccine?
Most of them are mild or moderate, short-term, and not everyone gets them.
The following side effects may occur in more than one in ten people:
tiredness
redness, bruising, pain, or swelling in the arm where the vaccine injection was given
headache
muscle pain
joint pain
nausea
fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher)
Redness or swelling at the injection site, diarrhea, vomiting, or a low blood platelet count (not causing symptoms) may occur in more than one in every 100 people.
Decreased appetite, dizziness, sleepiness, sweating, swollen lymph glands, or rash may occur in more than one in every 1,000 people.
Serious side effects, such as a severe allergic reaction, are very rare, i.e., in about one in every 100,000 people.
Your vaccinator is trained to provide medical treatment to patients affected by such severe allergic reactions.
In very rare cases, unusual blood clots and a low blood platelet count may occur in one in every 100,000 people.
One in five of those people could die.
The same risk of these blood clots is not reported after the second dose of the vaccine.
This very rare risk is higher among younger people.
In a very small number of cases, people have developed Guillain-Barré syndrome after receiving this vaccine.
It is a very serious but very rare condition, sometimes causing death.
Your family doctor, doctor, or vaccinator will be able to advise you on the risks and benefits associated with this vaccine.
The COVID-19 vaccine has passed the same clinical trials and safety checks that all other licensed vaccines must satisfy, but it is still a new vaccine and only a limited amount of information is available regarding long-term side effects.
As more and more people in Ireland and around the world receive this vaccine, it is expected that more information will become available about the side effects.
The HSE will regularly update the information on our website and, if necessary, will also update the information leaflets given to people when they receive their first or second dose of the vaccine.
Symptoms of the very rare blood clots
Although the risk of blood clots and low blood platelet counts is very low, you should be aware of the symptoms to watch out for.
Seek immediate medical help if you experience any of the following symptoms after receiving the Vaxzevria vaccine:

The very rare blood clots and low blood platelet counts are typically reported within 14 days after receiving the Vaxzevria vaccine.
Watch out for these symptoms in the weeks following your vaccination.
Symptoms of the very rare Guillain-Barré syndrome
Guillain-Barré syndrome causes fluid to leak from small blood vessels.
Although the risk of this condition is very low, you should be aware of the symptoms to watch out for.
sudden weight gain
You may also feel weak due to low blood pressure.
Guillain-Barré syndrome is typically reported within 4 days after receiving the Vaxzevria vaccine.
Watch out for these symptoms in the days following your vaccination.
Fever after the vaccine
Many people develop a fever after receiving a vaccine.
This usually occurs within two days (48 hours) after receiving the vaccine and goes away within two days.
You are more likely to get a fever after the first dose of the vaccine.
If you feel uncomfortable, take paracetamol or ibuprofen according to the instructions on the box or the information leaflet.
Seek medical advice if you are concerned.
Are there any people who should not receive the COVID-19 vaccine?
You should not receive the COVID-19 vaccine:
if you are under 50 years of age. This is because there is a very rare risk of blood clots or low platelet counts in the blood after getting the vaccine.
Another vaccine will be offered to you.
if you have previously had a severe allergic reaction to any of the ingredients of the vaccine (including polysorbate 80).
A list of ingredients can be found in the Manufacturer's Patient Information Leaflet.
if you had a severe allergic reaction after the first dose of this vaccine.
if you had blood clots and low platelet counts in the blood after the first dose of this vaccine.
if you have previously had Guillain-Barré syndrome.
If you have had a severe allergic reaction immediately after any vaccine or injected therapy, you should speak to your Doctor before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
Most people will be able to safely receive the vaccine.
The vaccinator will be happy to answer any questions you have at your vaccination appointment.
He or she will also give you a post-care advice leaflet, as well as a vaccination record card with the name and batch number of the vaccine you received.
Should I get the second dose of the vaccine if I am under 50 years of age?
If you are under 50 years of age and have already received the first dose of the vaccine, you should receive your second dose after between 8 weeks and 12 weeks.
How long does it take for the vaccine to start working?
The vaccine will not start working until 3 weeks after the first dose.
The best protection against COVID-19 comes after the second dose, which you should receive between 8 weeks and 12 weeks after your first dose.
There is still a chance you could contract COVID-19 even after getting the vaccine.
Does the vaccine work in everyone?
Vaccines prevent at least 2 to 3 million deaths every year worldwide and protect many more from lifelong diseases.
Millions of people around the world have received COVID-19 vaccines.
There is strong, reliable evidence that COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19.
They are an incredibly effective way to prevent deaths and serious illness caused by COVID-19.
If you have a weakened immune system, there is no extra risk with the vaccine, but it may not work as well for you.
After I receive the vaccine, will I not be able to spread COVID-19 to others?
We do not yet know if vaccinated people can spread the virus to others.
That's why it's so important that we continue to follow public health advice to stop the spread of the virus.
Above all, you must still do the following:
wash your hands regularly
How long will the immunity from the vaccine last?
It is not yet known how long immunity will last.
Clinical trials are currently underway to solve this question.
More information

You can also talk to a healthcare professional about the vaccine – your General Practitioner, your Pharmacist, or a member of your healthcare team, for instance.
How can I report side effects?
The regulatory authority in the Republic of Ireland is responsible for medicines, medical devices, and other health products.
As part of its role in monitoring the safety of medicines, the Authority operates a system through which healthcare professionals or members of the public can report any suspected adverse reaction (side effect) associated with medicines and vaccines that occur in Ireland.
The Authority strongly encourages the reporting of all suspected adverse reactions (side effects) associated with COVID-19 vaccines to support the continuous monitoring of their safe, effective use.
You can ask your Doctor or a family member to report it on your behalf as well.
As much information as known should be provided, and where possible, the batch number of the vaccine should also be mentioned.
The Authority cannot provide clinical advice on individual cases.
Members of the public should contact their healthcare professional (their Doctor or Pharmacist) if they have any medical questions.

If you develop a fever more than two days after receiving the vaccine, or it lasts longer than two days, you should self-isolate and ask your General Practitioner to arrange a COVID-19 test for you.
If you develop COVID-19 symptoms after the first dose, you still need to receive the second dose.
Is it safe to get the vaccine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding?
There is no evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 vaccine is not safe for those who are pregnant.
In clinical trials, COVID-19 vaccines were not tested on pregnant women.
However, over 100,000 pregnant women have received the COVID-19 vaccine in the United States.
No safety concerns have arisen for them or their babies.
If you are pregnant, you should speak with your Obstetrician or family doctor about getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
The COVID-19 vaccine can be received while breastfeeding.
The vaccine we are offering you is called Comirnaty and is manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech.
This mRNA vaccine teaches your body how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response, without using the live virus that causes COVID-19.
The second dose must be received 28 days after the first dose.
Two doses of the vaccine are required to get the best protection.
You will need to get the second dose 28 days (four full weeks) after the first dose.
redness or swelling in the arm where the vaccine injection was given
diarrhea
Nausea, vomiting, or redness at the site of injection may occur in more than one in every 100 people.
Swelling will occur in more than one in every 1,000 people at the site of injection, general swelling or rash may occur, their lymph glands may swell, or they may have trouble sleeping.
Bell's Palsy is a rare side effect seen in more than one in every 10,000.

if you had a severe allergic reaction previously to any of the vaccine ingredients (including polyethylene glycol).
if you had a severe allergic reaction after the first dose of the vaccine.
If you had a severe allergic reaction directly to any vaccine, injected therapy, or polysorbate 80, you should speak with your Doctor before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
Most people will have immunity after receiving two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
This means they will be protected against COVID-19.
There is still a chance you could contract COVID-19 even after getting the vaccine.
If you have a weakened immune system, there is no extra risk with the vaccine, but it may not work as well for you.
The Authority strongly recommends reporting any suspected adverse reactions (side effects) associated with COVID-19 vaccines to support ongoing monitoring of their safe, effective use.
